Today is Sun Aug 27, and I am getting ready to start my new job.  When I next view this work, I want to be doing the following:

1.  Set up tests to verify that the About page is working correctly.  My current tests for the About page were written before moving the page to Firestore, and as of today they are all broken.
2.  Migrate the home page to Firestore and make tests for it.
3.  Create an employee-only access page that requires a user to be logged in in order to see it.
4.  Test the log-in functionality that keeps anyone else from seeing that page.
5.  Create styling for the current /login page
6.  Write code that will allow the logged in user to modify text in the page without modifying the document fields
7.  Include a text editor so that the user can more easily modify the text
8.  Style the text-changing page
9.  test the text-changing page
10. decide if I want to allow the user to modify the document fields and how that would work.
11. create the ability for the user to modify the images being displayed.  (see allowing-user-to-upload-and-modify-images.md notes)
12. test the modifications and the image changes
13. get back to making the rest of the site
14. footer
15. header
16. the rest of the pages
