Today is Sat Sept 2, and I am getting ready to start my new job.  When I next view this work, I want to be doing the following:


1.  Migrate the home page to Firestore and make tests for it.
2.  Create an employee-only access page that requires a user to be logged in in order to see it.
3.  Test the log-in functionality that keeps anyone else from seeing that page.
4.  Create styling for the current /login page
5.  Write code that will allow the logged in user to modify text in the page without modifying the document fields
6.  Include a text editor so that the user can more easily modify the text
7.  Style the text-changing page
8.  test the text-changing page
9.  decide if I want to allow the user to modify the document fields and how that would work.
10. create the ability for the user to modify the images being displayed.  (see allowing-user-to-upload-and-modify-images.md notes)
11. test the modifications and the image changes
12. get back to making the rest of the site
13. footer
14. header
15. the rest of the pages
