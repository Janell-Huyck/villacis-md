Hello Dr. Villacis!
Welcome to your future webpage
This is a large project that will take at least several months to get off the ground. As your new webmaster, I will be building out a business page for your DPC business. Here is what is involved in my offer:

What I will do:
Phase 1:
Phase 1 will involve getting a working webiste that contains all the basic functionality currently present in your website healthconnectionsdpc.
I will be working a minimum of 10 hours/week until this is complete. When it is complete, if you wish, we can deploy it to your personal domain name healthconnectionsdpc.com.

Phase 2:
Phase 2 will involve adding the ability for patients to schedule appointments online, and for you to be notified of those appointments via text or email, as requested. I will also include the ability for patients to receive confirmation about appointments they schedule.
I will be working a minimum of 5 hours/week until this is complete.

Phase 3:
Phase 3 will involve adding additional features as requested, such as the ability for patients to pay online, or for you to send out notifications to patients via text or email.
I will be working up to 5 hours/week until this is complete.
